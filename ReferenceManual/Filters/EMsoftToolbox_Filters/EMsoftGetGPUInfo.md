EMsoftGetGPUInfo {#emsoftgetgpuinfo}
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##
EMsoftToolbox (EMsoftToolbox)

## Description ##
The **EMsoftGetGPUInfo** filter does not take any input parameters and does not perform any action when the *Go* button is clicked. When the filter
is selected, it queries the hardware to figure out what kind of computing environment is available (CPU(s), GPU(s), ...) and relevant parameters for
each unit are listed in the *Filter Parameters* window.

The filter will determine the number of platforms, the vendor for each platform, and then all of the computational devices within each platform.
For each device, several parameters are listed:
- Device Name
- Device Vendor




## Parameters ##
