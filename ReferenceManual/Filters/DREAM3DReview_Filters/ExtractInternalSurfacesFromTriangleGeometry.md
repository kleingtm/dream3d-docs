Extract Internal Surfaces from Triangle Geometry {#extractinternalsurfacesfromtrianglegeometry}
=============

DREAM3D Review (Geometry)

## Description ##
This **Filter** extracts any **Triangles** from the supplied **Triangle Geometry** that contain any _internal nodes_, then uses these extracted **Triangles** to create a new **Data Container** with the reduced **Triangle Geometry**.  This operation is the same as removing all **Triangles** that only lie of the outer surface of the supplied **Triangle Geometry**.  The user must supply a **Vertex Attribute Array** that defines the type for each node of the **Triangle Geometry**.  Node types may take the following values:

| Id Value | Node Type |
|----------|-----------|
| 2 | Normal **Vertex** |
| 3 | Triple Line |
| 4 | Quadruple Point |
| 12 | Normal **Vertex** on the outer surface |
| 13 | Triple Line on the outer surface |
| 14 | Quadruple Point on the outer surface |

This **Filter** has the effect of removing any **Triangles** that only contain **Vertices** whose node Id values are 12, 13, or 14.  In general, this _node type_ array is created when the [original surface mesh is created](@ref quicksurfacemesh).   

It is unknown until run time how the **Geometry** will be changed by removing certain **Vertices** and **Triangles**.  Therefore, this **Filter** requires that a new **Data Container** be created to contain the new internal **Triangle Geometry**.  This new **Data Container** will contain copies of any **Feature** or **Ensemble** **Attribute Matrices** from the original **Data Container**.  Additionally, all **Vertex** and **Face** data will be copied, with tuples _removed_ for any **Vertices** or **Faces** removed by the **Filter**.  The user must supply a name for the new **Data Container**, but all other copied objects (**Attribute Matrices** and **Attribute Arrays**) will retain the same names as the original source.
