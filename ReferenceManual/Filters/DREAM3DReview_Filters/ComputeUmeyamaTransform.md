Compute Umeyama Transform {#computeumeyamatransform}
=============

## Description ##
This **Filter** computes the Umeyama transform between two unstructured **Geometries**.  An "unstructured" **Geometry** is any geometry that requires explicit definition of **Vertex** positions.  Specifically, **Vertex**, **Edge**, **Triangle**, **Quadrilateral**, and **Tetrahedral** **Geometries** are considered unstructured **Geometries**.  The Umeyama transform estimates the affine transformation that maximizes the _similarity_ (specifically, the covariance) between two n-dimensional point sets.  For two unstructured **Geometries**, this has the effect of estimating, in closed form, the affine transformation that best brings the **Vertices** of the moving **Geometry** into the reference frame of the **Vertices** of the fixed **Geometry**.  The algorithm may optionally incorporate scaling into the computation of the affine transformation matrix.

The moving and fixed unstructured **Geometries** do not need to be the same type, since only the **Vertex** positions are considered; however, the two unstructured **Geometries** need to share the same _number_ of **Vertices**.  This **Filter** will create an **Attribute Matrix** located in the **Data Container** of the moving **Geometry** in which to store the transformation matrix.  Note that the stored transformation matrix will be in _row major_ order.
