Average Vertex Array to Edge/Face/Cell Array {#averagevertexarraytoedgefacecellarray}

## Description ##
This **Filter** averages the selected **Vertex** array onto the **Edges**, **Faces**, or **Cells** of a mesh-like **Geometry**.  Mesh-like **Geometries** are those that require explicit definition of connectivity between **Vertices** and **Elements**, specifically **Edge**, **Triangle**, **Quadrilateral**, and **Tetrahedral** **Geometries**.  The **Element** type on which the averaged array will be stored depends on the **Geometry**: **Edge** **Geometries** result in an **Edge** array, **Triangle** and **Quadrilateral** **Geometries** result in a **Face** array, and **Tetrahedral** **Geometries** result in a **Cell** array.  

The value stored on each **Edge**, **Face**, or **Cell** is the _arithmetic mean_ of the values for all **Vertices** that belong to that **Edge**, **Face**, or **Cell**.  The user may also optionally select for the mean to be _weighted_; in this case, the average values are weighted by the distance of the **Vertex** from the **Edge**, **Face**, or **Cell** _centroid_ such that **Vertices** that are closer to the centroid contribute more strongly to the average value.

The selected **Vertex** array may be scalar or multicomponent; if the array is multicomponent, then each component value is averaged individually.  Therefore, the output averaged **Edge**, **Face**, or **Cell** array will have the same component dimensions as the input array.  The input array may also be of any primitive type; however, the output averaged array will always be of type _float_.
